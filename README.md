# URSA_DS_Prototype
A rough but functional driverstation for the [URSA](https://github.com/southegueneroboticsteam/URSA) robot project to be used until one of the other driverstation programs is finished. 

This driver station is programmed with the Processing IDE, it can run on any computer and the robot can be controlled with a gamepad or the on screen joystick, or with Android mode for Processing it can be run on an Android device and the robot can be controlled with the on screen joystick and on some devices, tilt.

## To build:

Get [the Processing IDE](https://processing.org/download/)

Get the Ketai, Game Control Plus, and UDP libraries from Processing's library manager (sketch>import library)

Get the Android Mode for Processing from the Add Mode option of the dropdown menu that opens when the "Java" box in the top right is clicked

Select the Java mode for running on a computer, or the Android mode for running on a phone or tablet. To install on Android, the device needs to have USB debugging enabled. Run the sketch.

See the URSA wiki for information on using the robot.
